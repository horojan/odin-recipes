    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Classic chicken adobo recipe that's simple to make and loved by all who try it. It has been modified to be a bit saucier than traditional adobo and is deliciously served over rice.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Two (2) tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>One (1) whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>One (1) large onion, quartered and sliced </li>
        <li>Two (2) tablespoons of minced garlic </li>
        <li>⅔ cup of low sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>⅓ cup of white vinegar</li>
        <li>One (1) tablespoon of garlic powder</li>
        <li>Two (2) teaspoons of black pepper</li>
        <li>One (1) bay leaf</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken pieces until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add onion and garlic to the skillet; cook until softened and brown, about 6 minutes. Pour in soy sauce and vinegar and season with garlic powder, black pepper, and bay leaf.</li>
        <li>Return chicken to pan, increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is tender and cooked through 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
