    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This fried chicken batter yields the crispiest, spiciest, homemade fried chicken I have ever tasted! It is equally good served hot or cold and has been a picnic favorite in my family for years.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>One (1) of quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>Four (4) of cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
        <li>One (1) ½ tablespoons of garlic salt</li>
        <li>One (1) tablespoon of ground black pepper</li>
        <li>One (1) tablespoon of paprika</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon of poultry seasoning</li>
        <li>One (1) ½ cups of beer, or as needed </li>
        <li>Two (2) egg yolks, beaten</li>
        <li>One (1) teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon of ground black pepper</li>
        <li>One (1) whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a deep-fryer.</li>
        <li>Mix three (3) cups flour, garlic salt, one (1) tablespoon pepper, paprika, and poultry seasoning in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Stir together 1 1/2 cups beer, remaining 1 1/3 cups flour, egg yolks, salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a separate bowl; thin mixture with more beer if the batter is too thick.</li>
        <li>Moisten chicken pieces with water, then dip in the dry mixture. Shake off excess and dip in the wet mixture, then dip in the dry mix once more.</li>
        <li>Fry chicken pieces in hot oil until well-browned and internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 15 to 18 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken pieces and drain on paper towels before serving.</li>
    </ol>
